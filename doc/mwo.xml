<Heading>Many-object structures</Heading>

The aim of this package is to provide operations for finite groupoids. 
A <E>groupoid</E> is constructed from a group and a set of objects. 
In order to provide a sequence of categories, with increasing structure, 
mimicing those for groups, we introduce in this chapter the notions of 
<E>magma with objects</E>; <E>semigroup with objects</E>
and <E>monoid with objects</E>. 
The next chapter introduces morphisms of these structures. 
At a first reading of this manual, the user is advised to skip quickly 
through these first two chapters, and then move on to groupoids 
in Chapter 3. 
<P/>
For the definitions of the standard properties of groupoids
we refer to P. Higgins' book ``Categories and Groupoids'' 
<Cite Key="HiGpd" /> (originally published in 1971, reprinted by TAC in 2005),  
and to R. Brown's book ``Topology'' <Cite Key="BrTop" />, 
recently revised and reissued as ``Topology and Groupoids'' 
<Cite Key="BrTopGpd" />.


<Section Label="sec-mwo">
<Heading>Magmas with objects; arrows</Heading>

A <E>magma with objects</E> <M>M</M> consists of 
a set of <E>objects</E> Ob<M>(M)</M>, 
and a set of <E>arrows</E> Arr<M>(M)</M> 
together with <E>tail</E> and <E>head</E> maps 
<M>t,h :</M> Arr<M>(M) \to</M> Ob<M>(M)</M>, 
and a <E>partial multiplication</E> 
<M>* :</M> Arr<M>(M) \to </M> Arr<M>(M)</M>, 
with <M>a*b</M> defined precisely when the head of <M>a</M> 
coincides with the tail of <M>b</M>. 
We write an arrow <M>a</M> with tail <M>u</M> and head <M>v</M> 
as <M>(a : u \to v)</M>. 
<P/>
When this multiplication is associative we obtain a 
<E>semigroup with objects</E>. 
<P/>
A <E>loop</E> is an arrow whose tail and head are the same object. 
An <E>identity arrow</E> at object <M>u</M> is a loop <M>(1_u : u \to u)</M> 
such that <M>a*1_u=a</M> and <M>1_u*b=b</M> 
whenever <M>u</M> is the head of <M>a</M> and the tail of <M>b</M>. 
When <M>M</M> is a semigroup with objects 
and every object has an identity arrow, 
we obtain a <E>monoid with objects</E>, 
which is just the usual notion of mathematical category. 
<P/>
An arrow <M>(a : u \to v)</M> in a monoid with objects 
has <E>inverse</E> <M>(a^{-1} : v \to u)</M> provided 
<M>a*a^{-1} = 1_u</M> and <M>a^{-1}*a = 1_v</M>. 
A monoid with objects in which every arrow has an inverse 
is a <E>group with objects</E>, usually called a <E>groupoid</E>.

<Description>
The simplest construction for a magma with objects <M>M</M> 
is to take a magma <M>m</M> and an ordered set <M>s</M>, 
and form arrows <M>(u,a,v)</M> for every <M>a</M> in <M>m</M> 
and <M>u,v</M> in <M>s</M>. 
Multiplication is defined by <M>(u,a,v)*(v,b,w) = (u,a*b,w)</M>. 
In this package we prefer to write <M>(u,a,v)</M> as <M>(a : u \to v)</M>, 
so that the multiplication rule becomes 
<M>(a : u \to v)*(b : v \to w) = (a*b : u \to w)</M>. 
<P/> 
Any finite, ordered set is in principle acceptable as 
the object list of <M>M</M>, but most of the time we find it convenient 
to restrict ourselves to sets of non-positive integers. 
<P/> 
This is the only construction implemented here for magmas, semigroups, 
and monoids with objects, and these all have the property 
<C>IsDirectProductWithCompleteGraph</C>. 
There are other constructions implemented for groupoids. 
<P/>
The output from function <C>MagmaWithObjects</C> lies in the categories 
<Index Key="IsDomainWithObjects"> <C>IsDomainWithObjects</C> </Index>
<C>IsDomainWithObjects</C>, 
<Index Key="IsMagmaWithObjects"> <C>IsMagmaWithObjects</C> </Index>
<C>IsMagmaWithObjects</C>, 
<C>CategoryCollections(IsMultiplicativeElementWithObjects)</C> and 
<C>IsMagma</C>. 
The <E>root object</E> of <M>M</M> is the first element in <M>s</M>.

<Description>
If the partial composition is forgotten, then what remains is a digraph 
(usually with multiple edges and loops). 
Thus the notion of <E>connected component</E> may be inherited 
by magmas with objects from digraphs. 
Unfortunately the terms <C>Component</C> and <C>Constituent</C> 
are already in considerable use elsewhere in &GAP;, 
so (and this may change if a more suitable word is suggested) 
we use the term <C>IsSinglePiece</C> 
to describe a connected magma with objects. 
When each connected component has a single object, 
and there is more than one component, 
the magma with objects is <E>discrete</E>.

A magma with objects whose underlying digraph has two or more connected

connected structures. 
These, in turn, can be combined together. 
The only requirement is that all the object lists should be disjoint.

The generators of a structure with several pieces is the union
