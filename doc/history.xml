<Heading>Versions of the Package</Heading>

The first version, <Package>GraphGpd</Package> 1.001, 
formed part of Emma Moore's thesis <Cite Key="emma-thesis" /> in December 2000,
but was not made generally available.
<P/>
Version 1.002 of <Package>GraphGpd</Package> 
was prepared to run under &GAP; 4.4 in January 2004; 
was submitted to the &GAP; council to be considered as an accepted package; 
but suggestions from the referee were not followed up.
<P/>
In April 2006 the manual was converted to <Package>GAPDoc</Package> format.
Variables <C>Star</C>, <C>Costar</C> and <C>CoveringGroup</C> were
found to conflict with usage in other packages, and were renamed 
<C>VertexStar</C>, <C>VertexCostar</C> and 
<C>CoveringGroupOfGroupoid</C> respectively. 
Similarly, the <C>Vertices</C> and <C>Arcs</C> of an <C>FpWeightedDigraph</C> 
were changed from attributes to record components.
<P/>
In the spring of 2006 the package was extensively rewritten 
and renamed <Package>gpd</Package>. 
Version 1.01 was submitted as a deposited package in June 2006.
Version 1.03, of October 2007, fixed some file protections, 
and introduced the test file <F>gpd_manual.tst</F>. 
<P/>
Version 1.05, of November 2008, was released when the website 
at Bangor changed. 
<P/>
Since then, the package has been rewritten again, 
introducing magmas with objects and their mappings. 
Functions to implement constructions contained in <Cite Key="AlWe" /> 
have been added, but this is ongoing work. 
<P/> 
Versions 1.09 to 1.15 were prepared for the anticipated release of &GAP; 4.5 
in June 2012. 
<P/> 
<Package>gpd</Package> became an accepted &GAP; package in May 2015. 
<P/>
In April 2017 the package was renamed again, as <Package>groupoids</Package>. 
<P/>
In August 2017 the implementation of groupoid homomorphisms was completely 
revised with the emphasis now on a mapping from a set of generating arrows 
to their images. 
<P/>
In September 2017 various functions were revised so that, at last, 
the operation <C>DiscreteNormalPreXModWithObjects</C> 
in <Package>XMod</Package> works again. 
This constructs a crossed module of groupoids with a connected range 
and a homogeneous, discrete source. 
<P/>
In recent versions there have been a number of changes of function 
name, such as <C>IsDigraph</C> becoming <C>GroupoidIsDigraph</C>. 
This is in order to avoid conflicts with the 
<Package>Digraphs</Package> package.
The intention is that these functions can revert to the original names 
in due course.
