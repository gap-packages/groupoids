<Abstract>
The &groupoids; package for &GAP;4 provides functions for 
the computation with groupoids (categories with every arrow invertible) 
and their morphisms; for graphs of groups, and graphs of groupoids. 
The most basic structure introduced is that of <E>magma with objects</E>, 
followed by <E>semigroup with objects</E>, then <E>monoid with objects</E> 
and finally <E>groupoid</E> which is a <E>group with objects</E>. 
<P/>
It also provides normal forms for Free Products with Amalgamation 
and for HNN-extensions when the initial groups have rewrite systems 
and the subgroups have finite index. 
This is described in Section <Ref Sect="sec-gphgps"/>. 
It is planned to move this section to a new package 
<Package>Rewriting</Package> in time for version 4.11 of &GAP;. 
<P/>
The &groupoids; package was originally implemented in 2000 
(as <Package>GraphGpd</Package>) 
when the first author was studying for a Ph.D. in Bangor.
<P/> 
The package was then renamed <Package>Gpd</Package> and 
version 1.07 was released in July 2011, to be tested with &GAP; 4.5. 
<Package>Gpd</Package> became an accepted &GAP; package in May 2015. 
<P/>
In April 2017 the package was renamed again, as <Package>groupoids</Package>. 
<P/> 
Recent versions implement many of the constructions described in the paper 
<Cite Key="AlWe" /> for automorphisms of groupoids. 
<P/>
The latest version is &GROUPOIDSVERSION; of &GROUPOIDSLONGRELEASEDATE;.  
<P/>
Bug reports, comments, suggestions for additional features, 
and offers to implement some of these, will all be very welcome.
