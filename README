                   The Gpd package - version 1.31

This is the README file for the GAP package ``Gpd''. 

This package allows for the computation of finite groupoids, both connected
and with several components.  Graphs of groups and graphs of groupoids are
also constructed, allowing the calculation of normal forms for Free Products
with Amalgamation and for HNN extensions when the initial groups have
rewriting systems.

Version 1.001 was called ``GraphGpd'', and  formed part of 
Emma Moore's PhD thesis in December 2000.
Version 1.002 was prepared for the GAP 4.4 release in January 2004,
and deposited in the incoming directory on the St Andrews ftp server.

In the spring of 2006 the package was renamed ``Gpd'' 
and extensively rewritten, 
with documentation in GAPDoc format.
Version 1.01 was deposited in June 2006. 
Version 1.03 was released in October 2007. 
Version 1.05 was released on 21st November 2008. 
Version 1.07 was prepared for the anticipated GAP 4.5, 
and version 1.15 came out with the first release in June 2012. 
The latest version, 1.31, was released on 17th December 2014 for GAP 4.7. 
A more detailed history is included as Chapter 8 of the manual, 
and in the file CHANGES.

The ``Gpd'' package is distributed with the accepted GAP packages.
