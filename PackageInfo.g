"The groupoids package provides a collection of functions for computing with \

These are based on the more basic structures of magmas with objects \
and their mappings. \
It provides functions for normal forms of elements in Free Products with \
Amalgamation and in HNN extensions. \
Up until April 2017 this package was named Gpd.",
